# Map of vegan and vegetarian restaurants in Jihomoravsky kraj, Czechia

The map can be found here: [Vege-JMK map](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/vege-jmk_557579)

The data is downloaded from OpenStreetMap's database via [overpass-api.de](https://overpass-api.de/) every night and automatically updated to this repository. 
The idea came from [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) via Honza Javorek  - thank you.
The data is then loaded to [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/).

## Purpose

OSM is great - everyone with a computer or mobile phone can contribute. 
I've been adding _vegan_ and _vegetarian_ tags in my surroundings but found it hard to track another kind of changes.
When restaurant ceases to exist or changes menu it hardly ever gets to my radar. 
I want to make those changes visible and hopefully increase the quality of vegans' and vegetarians' life in Southern Moravia.

## How to contribute
Are the data no longer accurate? There are some possibilities for you.
- **The best and recommended**: learn to edit OpenStreetMap. 
Short yet exhausting summary can be found [here](https://github.com/Rudloff/openvegemap#how-to-contribute).
- Also working: open New issue and write what has changed and where.
